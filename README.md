## Scenario Description
The task at hand is to create a data model and build a relational database to represent the basis of an online food delivery service in the United States! Our data model consists of 10 separate entities with the orders entity being the central focus of our model. The orders that customers place allow us to connect with the restaurants our drivers pick up from, where the destination of our orders are, and the customers we deliver to along with their complaints or problems they have with our service. Our main goal is to accurately describe our day-to-day activities and the relationships that happens within our business. To fully show the detail of these relationships, there are a multitude of attributes within each entity filled with general, sample data. Through the use of functional queries, we are able to see where our company flourishes and where it lacks perfection. These queries will show us where we need to improve and how we can be the best possible service for the Srini's Steets Eats' customers!

## Ten Queries



7. Query 7 lists the city and its total revenue that is the highest profit across all cities.

As a manager of Srini Street Eats, one needs to be aware of their success in relation to their clients’ geographic locations to determine future resource allocation. Based on the profit, one can strategize on how to allocate resources like drivers, vehicles, and customer service employees in accordance with their future goals. Since Miami produced the highest total revenue of $356, one can first analyze its geographical and demographic advantages through customers, their reviews, and order products. A restaurant’s location can influence order products because of the different population, culture, and climate. Then, one can observe how drivers and customer service employees were dispatched to maximise customer satisfaction and hence restaurant success in Miami. Finally one can implement a similar strategy towards cities near Miami and/or cities with similar geographical and demographic structures.

Note; May have to change the question to list top 5 cities instead of just one


8. Query 8 lists the percentage of restaurants with review ratings below 3.

  IMAGE 
  
As a manager of Srini Street Eats, one needs to be aware of their clients’ success to determine whether the current resource allocation provides maximum benefit for the company’s goals. Since 40% of the client restaurants have review ratings below 3, there needs to be slight improvements. Firstly, one has to determine the top restaurants that contribute to the 40%. Secondly, their review descriptions need to be sourced out to determine the percentage of problems that were caused by Srini Street Eats. If it is high, the contract between Srini Street Eats and the restaurant may be continued. If it is low, the contract needs to be analyzed and re-considered as the problems lie with the restaurant, and Srini Street Eats have little to no managerial control over the restaurant. 

Note; Question may need further edits
